    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p><b>Every family has been touched by the addiction crisis</b>, but too many of us don't talk about it. Every single one of us bears the weight of feeling like THE ONLY family or community with these issues. Shame follows stigma, and treating addicts whom we don't know harshly is the way we end up overcompensating and proving that we ARE respectable.</p><p>Maybe, if we knew everyone had a story like ours, we would treat all addicts like someone's struggling family member.</p><p><a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8pw9JrJxB0SZDZDSSC12_CuGY4GJtWtNnyE76qtcykBUOUk4WTg5N1ZKSERMQ01FU0paTURLM0FSWC4u"  onclick="window.open(this.href, 'new', 'popup'); return false;"><b>Have your own story to share?

  <p><b>I grew up with a father who struggled with alcoholism.</b> We had a pretty normal upbringing – we lived in a townhouse, we had a dog. Our family (mom, dad, brother, sister, and I) went on vacations when we could afford them. I played sports. My dad used to coach my soccer games when I was little, and is probably the reason I still love sports.</p><p>I think anyone strong or weak can overcome alcoholism, and different people deal with it differently. For some, they can just put the bottle down once they realize they have a problem. I’ve seen other family and friends do this. For others, it can be a lifelong struggle where they fall on and off the wagon. I’ve also seen this. Some people need a lot of help and are afraid to ask for it, especially as men.</p><p>Men do a terrible job talking about our feelings and asking for help.</p><p>My father always had confidence issues, and a few job losses and debt made that worse. For him the answer seemed to be at the bottom of plastic bottles of vodka. Later, we found he always drank the little mickeys because those were less conspicuous inside a jacket pocket. Plastic doesn’t clink on keys or lighters. We figured this out when we demolished a dilapidated shed in the backyard that was full to the ceiling with little plastic vodka bottles. When I opened it, it was like a scene from a movie – bottles poured out onto the ground all around me. He was a very high-functioning alcoholic, so I think only then did we realize the full scope of his problem. I’m not going to lie, after he left, it was pretty cathartic to destroy the shed and throw out everything it contained.</p><p>Everyone is more confident when they’re drunk. In a very narrow (daily) scope, it made it easier for him to deal with life, instead of facing himself and his issues.</p><p>He was too proud and stubborn to ask for help, and it led to his deteriorating relationship with me and the family. Like I mentioned, eventually, he just left. I think it was easier than trying to fix himself. His relationships with us had deteriorated to a point where I guess it was easier to cut himself loose and start over.</p><p>This was more than a decade ago, and for a long time there has been minimal (if any) contact. I imagine there’s a lot of guilt and fear there around facing any of us. I did hear he eventually got sober, and hope he’s doing well. His problem though, was he never had the confidence to ask for help. It’s interesting because by all rights he was a tall, handsome, muscular man. I think the problems still exist, as we’ve completely stopped talking. I think he’d have to face us which is something he doesn’t have the confidence (sober or not) to do.</p><p>I’m at peace with his decision to leave. Life for my mom was financially harder, but I think life was actually easier after he left. It made my family tighter, and we’ll do anything for each other. The worst part about his absence was the way it affected my siblings. I knew him a little better than they did, and knew it wasn’t because of us he left – he has issues that are beyond us. But, they went through some hard years of depression and anxiety. They had a dad that was there for most of their lives and then (in their minds) decided that we weren’t worth staying for. This isn’t to say that I don’t think my parents should have divorced – they absolutely needed to. By “staying” I mean staying in their (our) lives. When he left, he removed himself completely, and I’m sure fell face-first into a bottle of 80 proof. But you can’t change people who don’t want to change themselves. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t get it to stop drinking unless it wants to.</p>

  <p><b>My uncle on my mom’s side was [an alcoholic].</b> He had a bad brain injury from a car crash which we believe onset his bi-polar disorder. When he drank, he would become manic. He would think gangs of people were after him; he thought he was going to make a million dollars by buying and selling secretly valuable items; he thought he was going to be a rockstar in a world-famous band, despite not playing any instruments. And then he would stop drinking and he would become severely depressed. He attempted suicide once (that I know of) by downing a full prescription bottle of pills. He swore it was an accident, but we knew what it was. He was lonely. It was a cry for help.</p><p>After his accident, I think he used drinking as a way of self-medicating. He was a very high-functioning alcoholic for a while. He could, and would, drink a full 40 ounce bottle of vodka every night, and get up and go to work in the morning. I didn’t believe this at all (I think I’d be dead if I drank that much in one sitting, let alone working the next day) until I talked with my cousins and aunt about it, who all swear this was his routine.</p><p>Eventually, the drinking led to the deterioration of his relationship with his family as well, and he and my aunt divorced. He tried to stay in contact with his daughters, but the manic episodes and constant boozing made it hard. The problem with my uncle was that he was a sweet person when he was sober, and he tried on many occasions to get clean. He loved his daughters and his siblings, and he did try to get better for them. He never gave up, and always believed that he could do it one day, even if he fell off the wagon a few times.</p><p>And man did he ever. He was found once (after a long sober stint) beaten almost to death, just outside his apartment door. His skull was cracked with a baseball bat (which made us wonder: were gangs of people after him after all?), and he had an absurdly high blood alcohol level when they brought him to the hospital. We’ll never know what happened that time or why – and he sure as hell didn’t remember.</p><p>Another time, my mom got called because he was running outside, barefoot in his underwear and was picked up by the cops. He got drunk, went manic, and for god only knows why, ran outside almost naked.</p><p>He’d call us with these extravagant plans for how we were going to book trips to Hawaii, or he’d call us to inform us on the inner workings of various mobs around the city. “If you ever need anything, anything give your uncle a call ok? I know some guys who know some guys.” What I need, uncle, is you to put that bottle back down and pick up the god-damn bi-polar meds again.</p><p>When he died, he was trying to get help. He checked himself into the psych ward because he was really trying to get better. He was determined to get better and face his bi-polar disorder with real medical assistance. He wanted to keep himself supervised and away from alcohol. I take a lot of solace in knowing he went down trying. It wasn’t a weakness he had in fighting his alcoholism; it was a strength he had to never give up.  He died peacefully in the hospital psych ward. He had severe COPD from years of smoking (mostly cigarettes, but also weed), and his lungs just didn’t have it in them anymore to do their job properly. After decades of struggle, he got to die sober, and I’m proud of him for that.</p>

    <p><b>I struggled with substance addiction that resulted in a stay at a long-term treatment facility.</b> My addiction to drugs allowed me to push my feelings away/ignore and instead escape a reality I was not emotionally mature enough to deal with. The only goal during my active drug use was to get the next "high" and forget/avoid feeling anything remotely painful. As a person, I changed during my addiction. Values, ethics and morals I held before my active drug use went out the window. I became a liar, cheater, and thief with the sole purpose of procuring the next dose. I hurt my family, friends and myself. After drug rehab, I spent time with a psychotherapist accepting and DEALING with the childhood trauma (domestic violence) I experienced. It was after many therapy sessions that I decided to live life without the use of any mood or mind altering substances. I am happy to report that I am currently clean and sober. Do I still have cravings? Absolutely, in social situations there is the desire to join in celebrations. The problem? I have an addictive personality and the risk/reward ratio is just not worth the cost of losing everything. For today, I am choosing to stay clean and sober.</p>

    <p><b>Multiple members of my family have been/are addicts.</b> Specifically to alcohol, smoking, and drugs. None have been substantial enough to severely affect my own life, but I've seen how their actions change under the influence and how it changes their life. A core memory of my childhood, when I was probably 5 ish years old, is when I was afraid of a nightmare or a stranger in my room. I called for my mom multiple times, but she didn't come to my room. After getting over fear-paralysis, I walked out to the front door, seeing through the window that my mom was smoking on the porch and didn't hear me. While as an adult I can see that she just didn't hear me, as a child I see how that feeling affected my life and sense of trust. It only takes one moment to change a child's perspective, and it's just a normal tuesday for their parent/s.</p></p>One of my mom's friends is an alcoholic, and while I think he's a dick in general, it's much worse with alcohol. I've watched the effects on their family and (with prior knowledge of psychology in children) seen how much it's affected their children. Especially as parents, they've been seeing their children as loud, annoying, and refusing to listen when they really just need attention and love. Substance abuse takes place of the most important things in someone's life, to the point where - to an outside perspective - it's a trade-off.</p><p></p>From seeing these struggles in my family and family friends I've noticed how there's a great amount of struggle but very little education/support on the topic. It's like an elephant in the collective room. All of us are aware of it, but very few speak of it.</p>

    <p><b>I grew up in a home where drinking alcohol was normal.</b> Anyone could help themselves if they wanted to. Alcohol was served at the table and even as children, we were allowed to have a drink. Drunkenness was an excuse for violence in my home. If something happened, it was because they were drinking too much, instead of taking responsibility for themselves. This household attitude especially became a problem once my siblings became adolescence. One of my brothers became addicted to alcohol when he was only 10-years old. Today, he also struggles with drug addiction and lives in social housing in Toronto. He goes to the methadone clinic to maintain his own level of stability. I made a choice a long time ago that I would have a different life. I rarely have a drink today because it is my way of honouring what I have learned from the violence I witnessed in my childhood. It's my way of living in the present.</p>

    <p><b>My grandparents live in an upscale suburb.</b> They're well-off: comfortably retired, sent their kids to private schools, hoping to leave an inheritance for their grandchildren. They're good people too. I met a cousin once-removed maybe once before attending his funeral a few years ago. He was a heroin addict, I think. Struggled for years. One night, he called his Aunt and Uncle in a panic. He needed money urgently. They didn’t ask questions. They didn’t judge. They left a few hundred dollars on their porch. Because that’s what you do for family.</p>
